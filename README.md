# intercommunication-ai-gpt-llama
 GPT NEO with Llama Tkinter GUI

This script intercommunicates between the Llama model and GPT-Neo in a loop. It processes a topic from a given list, generates a response using the Llama model, and then uses that response as input for GPT-Neo. GPT-Neo generates another response, which is then used as input for the Llama model in the next iteration. This intercommunication process continues for a specified number of iterations or until stopped by the user.
